# Animal Crossing Analysis
 
As a gamer, one of my favorite games is Animal Crossing. When I started searching for public databases to work on, I found that one of the most up-voted databases was from Animal Crossing New Horizons (ACNH). Therefore, I thought it was a great topic to start as my first personal project in Data Analysis with R. 

The objective is to perform a thorough analysis of fishes and insects that can be caught in Animal Crossing New Horizons to improve the strategic decisions of gamers, residing in the Northern Hemisphere, to speed up the time to save Bells.

The questions that will be answered include the following:

1. What is the count of animals that make up each category (insects vs fish)?
2. What is the lowest, average and highest selling price per category (insects vs fish)?
3. Which are the top 20 animals with the highest selling price that can be sold at Tom Nook’s shop?
4. Which are the 20 animals with the lowest selling price that can be sold at Tom Nook’s shop?
5. Which are the top three months where you can find more animals to catch?
6. Which is the location where the most animals can be found?
7. Is there a relationship between the location of the species and its selling price?
8. Is there a relationship between the color of the species and its selling price?
