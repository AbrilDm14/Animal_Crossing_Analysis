# Animal_Crossing_Analysis

As a gamer, one of my favorite games is Animal Crossing. When I started searching for public databases to work on, I found that one of the most up-voted databases was from Animal Crossing New Horizons (ACNH). Therefore, I thought it was a great topic to start as my first personal project in Data Analysis with R. 

The objective is to perform a thorough analysis of fishes and insects that can be caught in Animal Crossing New Horizons to improve the strategic decisions of gamers, residing in the Northern Hemisphere, to speed up the time to save Bells.
